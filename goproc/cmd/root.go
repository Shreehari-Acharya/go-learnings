	Long: `goproc is a CLI tool written in Go that provides detailed information
about system processes and memory usage. It leverages Go's standard library
and third-party packages to fetch and display this information in a user-friendly
manner. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or just curious about
your system's performance, goproc offers a simple way to access vital system
metrics directly from the command line.`,

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
